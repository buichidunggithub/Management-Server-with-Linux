### Introduction
  
> If you are using any major operating system you are indirectly interacting to shell. If you are running Ubuntu, Linux Mint or any other Linux distribution, you are interacting to shell every time you use terminal. In this article I will discuss about linux shells and shell scripting so before understanding shell scripting we have to get familiar with following terminologies

* Kernel

* Terminal

### What is Kernel

> The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everthing in the system. It manages following resources of the Linux system - 

* File management
* Process management
* I/O management
* Memory management
* Device management etc.

### What is Shell

> A shell is special user program which provide  an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readble commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
